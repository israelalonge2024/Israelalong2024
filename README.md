# Hey, I'm Israel 👋  

I'm an **Aspiring Frontend Developer** 💻 who loves building clean, modern, and responsive websites 🌐.  
Currently exploring **HTML, CSS and JavaScript** ✨ as I work towards becoming a professional frontend developer.  

I enjoy turning ideas into projects — from simple practice websites 📝 to larger apps like a **Biochemistry website** for Fuoye* 🎓 and a **Mapty app to track your location** 🗺️.  
I’m passionate about **designing beautiful UIs**, learning new technologies, and writing code that makes life easier 🚀.  

When I’m not coding, I’m **experimenting with new project ideas**, learning from mentor(Danztee)🍪.
